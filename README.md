# Firebase Asynchronous Operation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions related to asynchronous operations. The `admin.auth().createUser()` function is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't complete immediately. The original code attempts to use the result of this function before it has finished, leading to data misassociation and inconsistency.

The solution shows how to properly handle the asynchronous nature of the function using promises or async/await to ensure the data is correctly associated with the newly created user after the user creation process is complete.
